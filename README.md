This repository is the official implementation of [CLEVR-X: A Visual Reasoning Dataset for Natural Language Explanations](todo). It contains code to generate the CLEVR-X dataset and a [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) dataset implementation.

Below is an example from the CLEVR dataset extended with CLEVR-X's natural language explanation:

![A synthetically rendered image of a small cyan metallic cylinder, a large purple metallic sphere, a large blue matte cube, a large brown matte cylinder and a large green metallic cylinder (from front to back) on an infinite flat matte gray surface.](images/CLEVR_val_005182.png)
> **Question:** There is a purple metallic ball; what number of cyan objects are right of it?

> **Answer**: 1

> **Explanation**: There is a cyan cylinder which is on the right side of the purple metallic ball.

## CLEVR-X Dataset Download

The generated CLEVR-X dataset is available here: [CLEVR-X dataset](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/qe1wfahldk3pd7l/AADnsGTUInU5-eLCjyor0Iapa?dl=0) (~1.21 GB).

The download includes two JSON files, which contain the explanations for all CLEVR train and CLEVR validation questions (`CLEVR_train_explanations_v0.7.10.json` and  `CLEVR_val_explanations_v0.7.10.json` respectively).
The general layout of the JSON files follows the original CLEVR JSON files. The `info` key contains general information, whereas the `questions` key contains the dataset itself. The latter is a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary is one sample of the CLEVR-X dataset.

Furthermore, we provide two python pickle files at the same link. Those contain a list of the image indices of the CLEVR-X train and CLEVR-X validation subsets (which are both part of the CLEVR train subset.)

Note, that we do not provide the images of the CLEVR dataset, which can be downloaded from the original [CLEVR project page](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jcjohns/clevr/).

### Obtaining the CLEVR-X Splits

As stated above, the two python pickle files (`train_images_ids_v0.7.10-recut.pkl` and `dev_images_ids_v0.7.10-recut.pkl`) contain the image indices of all CLEVR-X train explanations and all CLEVR-X validation explanations.

To separate these subsets, one must iterate through the samples in `CLEVR_train_explanations_v0.7.10.json` and check whether the `image_index` of each sample is either in the list contained in  `train_images_ids_v0.7.10-recut.pkl` or in the list contained in `dev_images_ids_v0.7.10-recut.pkl`.
